<h1>AKAN NAMES</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        The Akan naming system is a cultture that was developed by Ganaians. Children were given a <strong><em>day name</em></strong>
        which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. The tradition was shared though-out west Africa
        and the African Diaspora. Did you know that Ghana was the only country in the African continent that got
        independence in a peaceful way and was led by Kwame Nkruma,who happens to be Ghana's first president. Kwame 
        Nkrumah's Akan name is <em>Kwabena</em>.
